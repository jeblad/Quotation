# Citation

## Scope

This is an extension that adds basic features for quotes in citations. This is to facilitate continuous verification of the validity of those statements, and their reuse in wikitext on a wiki running the Mediawiki software.

The project is on-going, and as such will be extremely unstable &ndash; it might even trigger a meltdown of your computer. :)
