# Quotation

## Scope

This is an extension that adds basic features for quotes in quotations. This is to facilitate continuous verification of the validity of those statements, and their reuse in wikitext on a wiki running the Mediawiki software.

The project is on-going, and as such will be extremely unstable &ndash; it might even trigger a meltdown of your computer. :)

## Identification

The _head_ of the extension is targeted at an old version of the server software, not the current _head_ of [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Download). There are no attempts to make the extension compatible with new versions. The versions can be downloaded from Wikimedias git repository, or from GitHub.

Naming of this extension has changed from Quote to Ctation, and is not consistent.
